# mlb_player_hometowns

This was my second-ever personal (non-work, non-school, non-tutorial) coding project; I've been working on this little by little as time allows since some time in 2018.  


Why MLB player hometowns?  

I've always loved baseball (though admittedly, follow it less than I used to). And always though it kind of cool how many MLB players come from foreign countries, especially Latin America. I wanted to see a map of all of their home towns and as far as I could tell at the time there wasn't one out there. 

There is this, but it's only of the US:

And this seemed to suggest there used to be one, but the map/site mentioned seemed to no longer exist.
