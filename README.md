# mlb_player_hometowns

This was my second-ever personal coding project (non-work, non-school, non-set-of-tutorials); I did most of the initial work on this in 2018 and have been working on this little by little since then.  

**What does this do?** 

Uses the requests and bs4 libraries to web-scrape the player pages of mlb.com, and then for a given MLB team (or for all 30 teams if you like):
* uses gmplot to make a html/javascript file for viewing in a browser
* uses simplekml to make a kml file for viewing in Google Earth 

Example: locations of Seattle Mariners' hometowns, as of October 2021:

And another of Mariners players one I still had lying around on my machine from April 2018:

**Why MLB player hometowns?**  

I've always loved baseball (though admittedly, follow it less than I used to). And I always thought it kind of cool how many MLB players come from foreign countries, especially Latin America. I wanted to see a map of all of their home towns; and as far as I could tell at the time there wasn't one out there. 

There is this, but it's only of the US:

And then there's this, but the map/site mentioned seems to no longer exist.
